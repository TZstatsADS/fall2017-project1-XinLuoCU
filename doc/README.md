# Project: 
### Doc folder

"Proj_1_xl2614.rmd" is the R notebook file of my project and you can view the report through its pdf and html version. 

It seems like my html file is too big for openning it in the github, but you can download it and open it as .html file from your computer. [ I will recommend you to read the html version, because it has no break between pages ]
